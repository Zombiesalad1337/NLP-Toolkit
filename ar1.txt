Automatic Text Summarization gained attention as early as the 1950’s. A research paper, published by Hans Peter Luhn in the late 1950s, titled “The automatic creation of literature abstracts”, used features such as word frequency and phrase frequency to extract important sentences from the text for summarization purposes. Another important research, done by Harold P Edmundson in the late 1960’s, used methods like the presence of cue words, words used in the title appearing in the text, and the location of sentences, to extract significant sentences for text summarization. Since then, many important and exciting studies have been published to address the challenge of automatic text summarization.
Text summarization can broadly be divided into two categories — Extractive Summarization and Abstractive Summarization. Extractive Summarization: These methods rely on extracting several parts, such as phrases and sentences, from a piece of text and stack them together to create a summary. Therefore, identifying the right sentences for summarization is of utmost importance in an extractive method.
Abstractive Summarization: These methods use advanced NLP techniques to generate an entirely new summary. Some parts of this summary may not even appear in the original text.
In this article, we will be focusing on the extractive summarization technique.Understanding the TextRank Algorithm
Before getting started with the TextRank algorithm, there’s another algorithm which we should become familiar with – the PageRank algorithm. In fact, this actually inspired TextRank! PageRank is used primarily for ranking web pages in online search results. Let’s quickly understand the basics of this algorithm with the help of an example.
